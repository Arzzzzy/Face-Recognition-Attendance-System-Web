# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

** TITLE: Automated Attendance System with Facial Recognition**

ATTENDIFY - "Say goodbye to manual roll calls with advanced facial recognition technology for effortless attendance tracking."

**Description:**
  This repository contains the code and resources for a facial recognition system. This project is an automated attendance system that leverages facial recognition technology to streamline the process of marking attendance in a classroom setting. The primary objective is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of attendance tracking, reducing the manual effort required by instructors and minimizing the chances of errors or fraud.

  The API used is `face-api.js` from Vincent Muhler who is an Engineer from Germany. He built it on top of Tensoflow which is one of the most famous machine-learning libraries. `face-api.js` is a robust JavaScript library that facilitates the implementation of state-of-the-art face detection and face recognition functionalities directly in the web browser. It leverages deep learning models to perform various facial analysis tasks, all running efficiently on the client side without the need for a backend server.
